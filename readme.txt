== Description ==

= What is Optimum Documents all about? =

**Optimum Documents** allows WordPress users to embed documents using either the Microsoft Office Web Apps Viewer or the Google Document viewer. Optimum Documents only requires a url parameter, but provides the option to specify height and width.

What makes Optimum different than other similar plugins is that the options given allow a user to embed quite a few more document types. Read more about the different options that the Office and Google document viewers provide below.

= Office Document Viewer =

Microsoft's Office Document Viewer is an attractive way to embed Office documents of the DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX formats. The Office Viewer has a lot of neat features built into it's UI. Because of the limited support for extended document types, we've included the Google Document Viewer to pick up the slack.

= Google Document Viewer =

If you're needing to embed a PDF or an Office 2003 document, the Google Document Viewer provides an easy to use interface that loads quickly and contains a simple feature set.

This is a simple plugin that's easy to use, but if anyone may need help, contact us via the support page.
